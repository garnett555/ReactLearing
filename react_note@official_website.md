# React @ Official website
- JSX, a syntax extension of JavaScript, produces *React "Elements"*.
- `elements` and `components` are buliding blocks of React Apps. Elements are the smallest buliding blocks of React apps, an element describes whata you want to see on the screen. React DOM takes care of updating the DOM to match the React elements. Elements are what components are "made of". React elements are immutable, once you create an element, you cannot change its children or attributes. React DOM compares the element and its children to the previous one, and only applies the DOM updates necessary to bring the DOM to the desired state. Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about the each piece in isolation. Components are like JavaScript functions, they accept arbitrary inputs (called "props") and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen. Components can refer to other components in their output. This let us use the same component abstraction for any level of detail.
- You can embed any JavaScript expression in JSX by wrapping it in curly braces. You can use JSX inside of `if` statements and `for` loops, assign it to variables, accept it as arguments, and return it from functions.
- Since JSX is closer to JavaScript than HTML, React DOM uses `camelCase` property naming convention instead of HTML attribute names.
- All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props.
